# Random-Password-Generator

## Description
In this week's challenge, we were tasked with creating a random password generator using JavaScript. The password generator is fairly customizable, allowing us to choose between 8 - 128 characters, uppercase, lowercase, special and numerical characters. This task was an oppurtunity to use our current JavaScript knowledge plus some of our own research to create the random password generator. 

This solves the problem of having to make a randomized password manually and instead allows you to do so in a quicker and more effective way. During this task I've learnt how to use variables to store objects such as the special, numerical, upper and lowercase characters. Also how to call functions and how to use if statements. 

## Usage
